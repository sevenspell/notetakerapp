# week11-assignment Express Homework: Note Taker

## Description 

This project is to create an app that allows users to create notes and save them which will then save their entries into a database file behind the scene. Every note created will be displayed on the left of the page, for users to retrieve and review. 

Users can also choose to delete if they no longer want the note. Users can add and delete in no particular sequence thus making it a useful tool for them to keep notes.


## Usage 

1. Go to deployed app link.
2. Click on the 'Get Started' button.

## Notes
There is a check on the id assigned to each entry to ensure that there is no duplicate despite the random addition and deletion of note entries.
